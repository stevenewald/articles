## Titles (Very WIP)

1. *How I got a Netflix internship through open source* (most likely won’t do this, but would be eye catching)
2. *Contributing to open source as a student*
3. Come up with something clever?

## Goal of the article
Explain the benefits of contributing to OSS as a student, how to contribute, and alternatives to contributing

## Introduction (all WIP and will be modified and expanded)
- Catch readers attention by mentioning OSS->Netflix
    - Later, explain why you shouldn't do OSS for this reason
- Why you should contribute
- When you shouldn’t contribute
- Breifly explain what kind of OSS this article is refering to

## How to find something to work on
- Finding a project to contribute to and getting acquainted with codebase
- Finding and deciding on a change to implement
    - Multiple kinds of possible changes
- Making sure you're not in over your head

## How to actually implement the change (all high level)
- Explain that actual steps will vary by project
- Setting up dev tools and environment
- Coding standards
- When and how to get support (more common than you think in OSS)

## Submitting your change
- Testing
- Reviewing (yourself + codeowners)
- PR

## Alternatives to OSS contributions
- Code reads of popular projects
    - Many of the same benefits with much less commitment

## Conclusion TBD
